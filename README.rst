Lexical Clock
=============

This was just a little practice project to play with javascript, html, and css. I recreated a working version of the clock in the photo.

There are two versions of the clock included. The first is just basic html/css/js and the second is just a modification to use the jquery library to assist with javascript accessing the html DOM. The big difference was the major simplification turning off elements. Jquery was a lot simpler. This would be a useful project for a High School cs course.

Also thanks to CodeAcademy.com where I was working on tutorials that provided me the inspiration to do this.
